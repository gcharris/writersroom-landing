        <h1>Welcome to the Writer's Room</h1>

        <p class="lead">
            "Your AI-powered writers' room. You're the showrunner."
        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to a new way of creating. You are not typing into a chatbot. You are walking into a room of dedicated staff writers, assistants, and editors who know your voice, know your world, and wait for your instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are the <strong>Showrunner</strong>. Nothing happens without your vision. Nothing ships without your approval.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Concept</h2>

        <p>We built this platform on a simple truth: <strong>Professional creators don't work alone.</strong></p>

        <p>TV showrunners have a <strong>writers' room</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Staff Writers</strong> pitch ideas and write drafts.</li>
            <li><strong>Writers' Assistants</strong> track the story bible and continuity.</li>
            <li><strong>The Showrunner</strong> (that's you) directs the vision, picks the best ideas, and makes the final cut.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In our Writer's Room:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Staff:</strong> Advanced AI agents trained on <em>your</em> voice.</li>
            <li><strong>The Bible:</strong> A "Sovereign Codex" that remembers every character, rule, and plot point you've ever established.</li>
            <li><strong>The Notes Dept:</strong> A "Narrative Governor" that checks every draft for plot holes and continuity breaks before you even see it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <h3>1. Staffing Your Room (Voice)</h3>
        <p>Before we write a single word, we need to know who <em>you</em> are.</p>
        <p>You don't describe your style with adjectives ("witty," "dark"). You connect us to your work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect your <strong>Twitter/X</strong> to show us your public voice.</li>
            <li>Connect your <strong>Gmail</strong> to show us your professional voice.</li>
            <li>Upload <strong>past writing</strong> to show us your creative voice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We build a <strong>Voice Profile</strong> based on how you actually write. Your AI staff doesn't sound like a robot; they sound like <em>you</em> on your best day.</p>

        <h3>2. Building the Bible (Context)</h3>
        <p>Your staff needs to know your world:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect <strong>NotebookLM</strong> or <strong>Readwise</strong> to give them your research.</li>
            <li>Upload your notes, wikis, or character sheets.</li>
            <li>As you write, the room <em>remembers</em>. If you kill a character in Chapter 3, the AI won't try to use them in Chapter 10.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. The Daily Workflow</h3>
        <p>Instead of staring at a blank cursor, you lead the room:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brainstorm:</strong> Chat with your staff. "I need a scene where Sarah discovers the conspiracy."</li>
            <li><strong>The Pitch:</strong> Your staff generates <strong>3 Variants</strong> of the scene:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Variant A:</em> Plays it safe.</li>
                    <li><em>Variant B:</em> Takes a creative risk.</li>
                    <li><em>Variant C:</em> The wildcard.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Direct:</strong> You don't just edit; you choose. "I like the dialogue in A, but the action in C. Combine them."</li>
            <li><strong>Produce:</strong> Once you approve the draft, it flows directly to your output channels — whether that's a manuscript, a newsletter, or a video script.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What You Can Make</h2>
        <p>The Writer's Room adapts to your format:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Novelists:</strong> Establish a timeline and character arcs. Write chapter by chapter with perfect continuity.</li>
            <li><strong>For Podcasters/YouTubers:</strong> Turn a rough idea into a polished script, then auto-generate show notes and promotional tweets.</li>
            <li><strong>For Daily Creators:</strong> Use the <strong>Telegram Studio</strong> to brainstorm and draft on the go. Text your room a voice note, get a polished draft back in minutes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Two Ways to Play</h2>

        <h3>1. The Living Room (Mobile / Free)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interface:</strong> Telegram.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Fast, conversational, always with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Capture ideas, brainstorm on the go, quick drafts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>"Hey room, remember that idea about the cyber-noir detective? What if he was a ghost?"</em></p>

        <h3>2. The Workbench (Web / Pro)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interface:</strong> A beautiful, dark-mode desktop studio.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Deep work, surgical editing, broad views.</li>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Structuring entire seasons, editing beat sheets, managing the story bible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See your whole story laid out. Drag and drop beats. Visualize your character web.</p>

        <h2>Our Promise</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You Own It:</strong> You are the Showrunner. The IP is yours.</li>
            <li><strong>No Slop:</strong> Our "Narrative Governors" prevent the hallucinated nonsense typical of AI. If it breaks your rules, we rewrite it before showing you.</li>
            <li><strong>Middleware:</strong> We connect to the best models (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) and the best tools. You aren't locked in.</li>
        </ul>
